Live Service Simulations
==============================

As developers, we often provide Level 3 operational support for our applications in production. The levels are phased as follows:
0. Guidance or online help
1. Helpdesk - people that manage phones/emails at a service desk
2. Operations teams that provide 24/7 support for resolving recurring issues and providing ops support for live service maintenance (these are usually developers who have not worked on the application they support)
3. L3 developer support - this is where we come in and fix production bugs and resolve complex customer incidents


Our L3 team consists of a pool of engineers that will use rotas configured on tools like PagerDuty and provide 24/7 support for high priority incidents. As such, we have quarterly sessions of practicing the escalation and resolution process for out-of-hours incidents.

1. The entire team is subdivided into pairs.
2. Each pair will set a challenge in a test environment with a bug/defect either at an infrastructure or application level to another pair.
3. The teams take it in turn to resolve the issue while the others take notes, provide pointers etc.

The purpose of this is:
* Feast on pizza & beer
* It gives the various engineers the ability to test each other's knowledge and identify gaps in new pieces of functionality which they may not have worked on
* Allows teams to understand the exploits and vulnerabilities of their code
* Allows teams to identify issues with tooling/access etc that need to be rectified before they are scheduled to be on call next
* Reaffirm the process for escalations
* Team bonding
